Project is done

All features have been implemented and tested, this program works on the CIS 3110 Docker container and should be used in the same environment.

There should not be any memory leaks, formatting of strings displayed and on file may be different from mentioned in A2.pdf but in a more understandable reading.

Program is free of race conditions but may have busy waits as mutex locks populate critical sections.
